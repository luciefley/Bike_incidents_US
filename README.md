Data visualization project with Tableau - Data from Kaggle

## ABOUT
This project was an excercise to build a dashboard with Tableau Public that can have a real life application.
It was made in one afternoon.

## DATA
The data comes from Kaggle (link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/supratimhaldar/bikewiseorg-incident-and-location-data)), but is originally from Bikewise.org.
A website were users self report incidents. The dataset contains the location (Latitudes and longitudes), date and time of the incident, its type, a title and a brief description. 

## ANALYSIS
